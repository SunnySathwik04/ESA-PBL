The "Pan-Tilt Controlled ESP32-CAM Surveillance Car" project uses an ESP32-CAM module integrated with a pan-tilt mechanism to create a remotely controlled surveillance car. The ESP32-CAM streams real-time video wirelessly, while the pan-tilt system allows the camera's angle to be adjusted for optimal surveillance. The car's movement and camera control are managed via a mobile app or web interface, offering flexible, remote navigation. This project combines IoT, wireless communication, and robotics, providing a cost-effective solution for real-time monitoring and security. It can be used in various applications, offering dynamic surveillance capabilities for enhanced security.
